# What is Design?

The word _design_ commonly refers to: (a) The **activity** of designing, (b) The design **process**: how that activity is structured, (c) The **results** of that activity and process, _the_ design.

This is an abstract part of [Product Design Basics](https://www.uxdatabase.io/learning-blocks/block-i-product-design-basics): Understanding the basics of design, from the elements and principles of design to the different methodologies that exist to carry out a structured design process and know how to adapt it to each project.

So what really matters is defining what _a_ design is.

> "A Design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process."

A design refers to the plan for achieving a given objective. Color, shape, technology, and function each are means of realizing that objective. It would be straightforward, but usually we do not _call_ "a plan to make something" a design. There are many things that overlap with design in ways that can be confusing, especially in art and engineering.

## Design is not art

> "Art is a creation of which the main purpose is to convey an emotion."

Design is confused with art because of:

- _Entertainment_, which artists sometimes create to make a living while practicing their skills
- _Kitsch_, which imitates art, but is intended to be decorative or as a status symbol
- _Decoration_, which is added to things to make them less ugly or boring

Therefore, a designer is not necessarily an artist. That would be having no clue in design or, to make matters worse, no clue about art.

Why the confusion? Maybe it's because designers and artists have several tools and skills in common. In both art and design, it's common to make sketches and ever more detailed drawings before the final product.

### Why is design taught at art schools?

Designers and artists take inspiration from each other. Graphic arts and graphic design follow similar trends and movements. Art and design share a history. Design taught at art schools make objects mimic useful products to make statements, which is really not design.

> "Good design is created when looks and function are developed together."

Not all art creation is design, and not all design is art.

## Design is not engineering

In product development, engineering is about making systems that create products according to specifications. You save time and costs by having a plan—a design—before starting engineering.

In Web design, a designer could specify components in CSS.

> "The designer's goal should be an efficient handover of design specs to the engineer.

But it's still up to the engineer to check that code's validity and improve it where necessary before adding it to the production code. Sometimes design specs include instructions for machines. Designers and engineers share responsibilities for tasks. Some design work is engineering, but the essence of design is not.

## Design is not product management

An important part of product management is doing the planning around the creation of a new product.

The bare minimum of a design is a plan for the dimensions, appearance, and behavior of a product once it’s in the user’s possession. It doesn’t necessarily include a plan for the development process. That's handled by Product Management, therefore it's consider organizational.

But product management doesn’t create the design or do engineering. It’s a facilitating function for the product team (designers, engineers, product managers). It deals with the whole lifecycle of a product, from conception to sales, marketing and recycling.

A clear goal of product management is reducing development costs by making teams more efficient: a business function.

## Design of products and services

Products and services are often discussed in binary opposition to each other. This reflects the binary opposition between tangibles and intangibles. But when it comes to design, the difference between them is a difference of focus.

> "A product is a means of achieving a service, and a service is an objective."

In the case of using a product as a means of designing a service, designers design both a product and a service every time. Instead of separating products and services in design, we should continue to look constantly at both, without regard for their tangible or intangible status, because the product itself is a means to an end.

## Ram's 10 Principles of Good Design

1. **Innovative** — Imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology.
2. **Make a product useful** — Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could detract from it.
3. **Aesthetically pleasing** — Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.
4. **Make a product understandable** — A product should clearly express its function. It should be self-explanatory.
5. **Unobtrusive** — Design should be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.
6. **Honest** — It should not attempt to manipulate the consumer.
7. **Long-lasting** — It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.
8. **Thorough** — Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance.
9. **Environmental friendly** — It should make an important contribution to the preservation of the environment.
10. **As little design as possible** — Less is more.

## Types of Design

There are 3 widely known design principles—differentiated by their own areas. They are (1) Graphic Design, (2) Interaction Design, and (3) Industrial Design.

### Graphic Design

They work with graphical images, whether they be illustrations, typography, or images, and on a variety of media including print and web. A Graphic designer objective is to deliver messages with media they choose.

### Interaction Design

While digital design is intangible, a designer can still "design" the interaction digitally. Interaction designers, on the other hand, focus on digital products and interactive software design. It helps us to experience software or interface with screen-based hardware in order to achieve specific goals.

### Industrial Design

Industrial designers create physical products designed for mass-consumption by millions of people. Their objective is to study both function and form, and the connection between product, the user, and the environment.

## So, what is design?

Copying a product is not design. So design is making a plan to create something new, that hasn't been solved before, or solve it in a new way. _Design_ is shorthand for user-centered design and user-centric design.

> "A design is a plan to make something new for people, that they perceive as beneficial."

Design makes products successful because going straight to engineering would almost certainly increase costs. Fixing a mistake in engineering costs about 10 times the amount of fixing a mistake in design. Fixing a mistake in production costs about 100 times that.
